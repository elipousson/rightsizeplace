# Introduction

The **Preservation in Rightsizing Cities Toolkit** is a new initiative of the Preservation Rightsizing Network to support the work of a diverse preservation community in legacy cities from Chicago to Baltimore to Detroit and beyond. This initiative is intended to support a key goal of the Preservation Rightsizing Network to develop and share practical tools for constructively engaging in and influencing local planning processes and local strategies, with the goal of creating more livable communities and laying a foundation for the revitalization of historic neighborhoods.

We hope this toolkit can help preservationists, both volunteers and professionals, to broaden their understanding of rightsizing and preservation, learn about how legacy communities around the country are engaging with preservation issues, and locate the tools and resources. We invite you to join us in building and maintaining this resource by sharing experiences, ideas and examples from your communities.

## *The purpose of this toolkit*

Presented online by the Preservation Rightsizing Network, this toolkit is an ongoing project, updated by a community of volunteers. We want this toolkit to:

* Promote best practices and inspire experimentation

* Connect preservationists learn from experiences

* Improve our effectiveness (and evaluation of effectiveness?)

* Give a voice to preservationists who may feel isolated or disconnected in their communities (supporting one another)

* Connect

* Save time! (No need to start from scratch)

## *How the toolkit is organized*

The Toolkit is divided into a set of overlapping categories of **practice**. These categories include many traditional approaches to historic preservation but also take inspiration from new ideas and examples outside the existing preservation community. This toolkit is developed with the clear idea that, to succeed in legacy cities, preservation advocates must cultivate a more diverse skill set and a more inclusive community that attracts partners, professional colleagues, and volunteers who can join us in meeting the difficult challenges that many historic neighborhoods face.

Each category opens with a brief description of how a particular approach - e.g. architectural survey and documentation, interpretation with supporting programs and publications - is broadly conceived within historic preservation and the unique challenges or opportunities presented by applying such an approach within the context of Legacy Cities. Within each category, we have assembled specific examples and related resources for additional details.

*About the organizers*

Formed in the fall of 2013, the Preservation Rightsizing Network has the explicit goal of fostering a more interdisciplinary community through events with the Rightsizing Vacant Cities conference in Philadelphia, the National Trust for Historic Preservation meeting in Indianapolis and the Preservation in Legacy Cities conference in Cleveland. We believe users of this toolkit will reflect the broader diversity of the approaches and resources that follow. These resources are a direct outgrowth of the new conversations sparked by these meetings and we hope can continue to advance the discussion into the future.

The PRN Executive Committee consists of individuals from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, PlaceEconomics, Michigan Historic Preservation Network, and others from St. Louis, Baltimore, and other cities. The missions and goals of our individual organizations vary from housing assistance for low-income homeowners, enforcement and regulation within designated historic districts, advocating for the reuse of historic landmarks in weak market areas, and providing resources on historic preservation to support resident organizing around community and economic development. What we share is the desire to create more livable communities, lay a foundation for the revitalization of historic neighborhoods, and celebrate the rich cultural and architectural heritage that makes our cities the places we want to live.

## *Background*

Preservation advocates nationwide face the challenges of retaining historic assets, engaging new audiences, and encouraging smart change in their communities. Across legacy cities, however, preservation issues are acutely different from those communities working in cities on the rise.

Legacy cities across the Midwest and Northeast are dealing with the debilitating repercussions of deindustrialization, suburbanization, racial tensions, redlining, and foreclosure crises spanning the last few decades. Diminished population and tax bases, an excess of vacant and neglected building stock, and disinvestment in urban infrastructure are just a few of the effects of these historical trends.

In response to many of these issues, preservation organizations and advocates working on rightsizing in legacy cities are developing and expanding tools to address the distinct concerns facing their communities. Many issues center on conflict with local government priorities, scattered site and ad hoc demolitions, an imbalance of funds to support alternatives to demolition-first strategies, and feeling left out of decision-making processes as they relate to the built environment.

In the face of such challenges, preservationists are tackling these complex issues head on, collaborating across fields with new partners, using asset-based and data-driven preservation approaches, and encouraging municipalities to see rehabilitation and preservation as viable blight remediation strategies. Future trends suggest expanding and challenging traditional notions of preservation’s role in legacy cities through increasingly innovative projects and strategies on the ground and intensification of advocacy at the legislative level for increased funding to support strategic rehabilitation and mothballing practices.

## *Definition of key **terms*

### Rightsizing

Tailoring a city’s infrastructure, footprint, and city services to align with its current and projected population is referred to as "rightsizing." It is a term – unlike its predecessor “shrinking cities” – that implies that every city has a “right size,” and that the process of adjustment to achieve that shape is not a journey of shrinkage, decline, and failure but rather a proactive approach to planning for each city’s unique size and shape. It is a positive upturn to the otherwise discouraging narrative of decline, one that implies forward-thinking action. [Pulled from Emilie’s article; rework]

### Legacy City

"American legacy cities were once industrial powerhouses and hubs of business, retail, and services scattered across New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Midwest. Their factories provided jobs, and downtown areas contained department stores, professional offices, and financial institutions that served large regions. Since the mid-twentieth century, however, these cities have seen sustained loss of jobs and population, and now face daunting economic, social, physical, and operational challenges."

Mallach, Alan and Lavea Brachman

"Regenerating America’s Legacy Cities"

Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, Policy Focus Report/Code PF034, 2013"

### Blight

A word laden with the history of urban renewal efforts, blight -- in the context of the built environment -- refers to the decay, dilapidation, and deterioration of buildings due to neglect and failure to maintain. Blight can refer to vacant land as well, often in reference to plots whose lack of maintenance has resulted in overgrowth as well as dumping of trash and detritus. Many older American cities have specific blight ordinances. Common among blight definitions across ordinances is the identification of blighted structures as a health and safety hazard.

    * Detroit

    * St. Louis

### Abandoned Property

A piece of land, with or without structures, whose owner has stopped carrying out at least one of the significant responsibilities of property ownership (such as property maintenance or taxes), as a result of which the property is vacant or likely to become vacant; encompasses both occupied and unoccupied properties.[1]



### Code Enforcement

The administration of laws regarding property maintenance and construction.



### Land Banking

Acquiring, managing, and disposing vacant, abandoned, and foreclosed properties by public or community-based entities; the term ‘land bank’ is thus used interchangeably with ‘entity.’

### Mothballing

Stabilizing, securing, and protecting a vacant structure from weather damage and vandals while preserving the structure for future use.

### Receivership

The appointment of a receiver to abate the public nuisance created by abandoned properties; also known as conservatorship.

### Strategic Demolition

Applying rational criteria for choosing which buildings should be demolished and which retained; Linking demolition targets and priorities with specific stabilization, redevelopment and reuse goals and strategies; and engaging key players to ensure that decisions take all relevant considerations and perspectives into account.[2] Also resulting in the removal of a building in a way that protects the health of the neighbors and workers, provides for proper disposition of the waste materials from the building, and leaves the property ready for the most appropriate future reuse and which does not blight its surroundings.[3]

### Vacant Property

An unoccupied or illegally occupied piece of land, with or without structures, whose owner has stopped carrying out at least one of the significant responsibilities of property ownership (such as property maintenance or taxes).

# Advocacy & Organizing

An opening paragraph needed here defining advocacy (as opposed to lobby?), and listing basic to do’s:  Nonprofit organizations are exempt from taxation under section 501 c 3 of the IRS tax code and can jeopardize their exempt status if found engaged in lobbying as a substantial part of their activities. However… speaking on behalf of balanced rightsizing policy that also supports reuse and rehabilitation of viable existing properties is advocacy that individuals and nonprofits can conduct.

# Survey, Documentation and Designation

The preservation field has always catalogued built resources in order to preserve them. Building age, style, integrity, and significance are painstakingly recorded in detailed historic resource surveys, which advocates and planners sifted to suggest landmark nominations or historic district boundaries. Decades before big data became a common term, preservationists across the country were quietly amassing a cache of information on significant buildings.

Virginia Department of Historic Resources: "A historic resources survey locates and identifies properties within a specific geographic area and documents them to an established standard.  Historic resources survey involves collecting and organizing data from field investigations and gathering data from historical research, interviews, and planning studies.“

Surveys have been a tried and true resource to preservation and their application in Legacy City communities has never been more relevant.

* Survey informed by community input

* Large scale survey enabled by technology/volunteers

* Alternate approaches to traditional survey

### Examples

[Philadelphia Character Studies](http://www.design.upenn.edu/files/Character_Study_Project.pdf) - Cara can write brief description

[Detroit Historic Resource Survey](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/03/11/smartphone-survey/)

The **Detroit Historic Resource Survey (DHRS) **assessed nearly 18,000 buildings in eligible historic districts across six Detroit neighborhoods using smartphones and volunteers in just two weeks. The goal of the survey was to inform demolition decisions by the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) using Hardest Hit Fund demolition dollars. The DHRS aligned with the larger [Motor City Mapping](https://www.motorcitymapping.org/) survey and involved multiple non-traditional partners including the DLBA, Data Driven Detroit, Loveland Technologies, Detroit Blight Task Force, and LocalData.

In the field, volunteers asked three primary questions of each property. The answers from each of those questions aggregated into an HP Score: Very Important, Important, Less Important, or Not Historic. The HP Score was an opportunity to distill the more complex ideas of architectural integrity and neighborhood character into a usable format for decision-makers not familiar with those concepts. Survey results are now in the hands of the DLBA and being utilized to inform demolition decision-making on the ground in Detroit.

[SurveyLA](http://www.preservation.lacity.org/survey)

**SurveyLA** – the Los Angeles Historic Resources Survey – is Los Angeles' first-ever comprehensive program to identify significant historic resources throughout our city. The survey marks a coming-of-age for Los Angeles' historic preservation movement, and will serve as a centerpiece for the City’s first truly comprehensive preservation program. [from their site]

[Census of Places that Matter](http://www.placematters.net/places)

The **Place Matters** mission is to foster the conservation of New York City's historically and culturally significant places. These are places that hold memories and anchor traditions for individuals and communities, and that help tell the history of the city as a whole. Recognizing that such places often go unrecognized, Place Matters begins with surveying New Yorkers to learn about the places they care about and follow up with educational programs and advocacy to promote and protect these places and others like them.

[Austin Historical Survey Wiki](http://soa.utexas.edu/austin-historical-survey-wiki)

The **Austin Historical Survey Wiki** brings together citizens' local knowledge with the expertise of preservation professionals through an online application to improve the transparency, accuracy, and timeliness of historic survey information. Users are able to look up information using interactive maps and query tools, share information about historic resources, and access and upload photographs of historic resources. While the web tool was developed as an information system and public engagement tool for the City of Austin, the project is intended as a replicable model that can be used in other communities. [from their site]

[Discover Denver](http://www.discoverdenver.co/)

Discover Denver is a building and neighborhood survey meant to identify historic and architecturally significant structures citywide. Historic Denver, Inc. leads this collaborative project in partnership with the City and County of Denver and History Colorado. The survey will gather information using public records, neighborhood canvassing, academic research, and tips from the public. Findings from the survey will then be accessible online so that everyone can learn about Denver’s past — building by building. [from their site]

# Public History Research, Oral History, and Interpretation

Public history is history, practically applied. It is based on the understanding that...history is learned in a variety of places, and in a variety of ways, according to the Editor Emeritus of the [Public History Resource Center](http://www.publichistory.org/what_is/definition.html), University of Maryland.  History important for how it informs and impact our day to day lives.

# Partnerships

Preservationists need partners. We need to expand our audiences and stretch our message to reach people across sectors, interests, and neighborhoods in our cities. This means creatively thinking about potential partnerships outside the usual suspects of preservation allies. Outlined below are examples of methods for connecting with broader audiences.

## *Networking*

Below is a framework that can be used as a starting point for identifying and connecting with new partners, whether grassroots organizations or citywide agencies, in every community:

1. **Clarify Your/Your Organization’s Priorities**: Do you want to engage a particular demographic, such as youth or seniors? Are you trying to expand your audience to new fields, such as food, education, or the arts? Is there a neighborhood in the city you’d like to be more involved in? Being clear about your group’s priorities will help you hone in on the next steps.

1. **Identify the Organization(s) Working In Those Areas**: Determine who’s active in the neighborhood (e.g. look through papers and sites online that cover local issues, ask your contacts, etc.) and what those organizations’ initiatives are. Whether it’s a citywide organization focusing on a specific neighborhood or a local CDC working with a particular demographic, get a good sense of their recent projects and current organizational goals.

1. **Find Intersections: **Connect your organization’s mission and projects to theirs – and be creative! Knowing the organizations and groups working in your area of interest and having honed in on their projects, initiatives, and mission, you’re well positioned you to figure this out.

1. **Reach Out**!: Send an email to the person whose name was in the article you read who is leading the initiative and include the Executive Director. Let them know you admire their initiatives and would love to speak about where there might be alignment between your groups.

1. **Be Persistent**: If you don’t get a reply within a reasonable timeframe, try again. Don’t give up after the first or even second attempt. You have something to offer and they have nothing to lose.

1. **Listen**: When you do get together, recognize they may have a strong idea of what preservationists are, do, or stand for. Do a lot of listening and question asking – What are their needs and goals? Where is their organization heading? – and find ways to tie preservation in as a complementary tool.

In 2008, the Michigan Historic Preservation Network (MHPN) and the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT) partnered to explore how a model developed in Michigan for introducing preservation trades education can be promoted and replicated across the United States. Experts from a wide range of preservation trades organizations and educational institutions convened in Detroit, Michigan to bring together preservation education leaders from across the country who have experience in implementing preservation trades programs to share and document their knowledge and ideas. They reviewed the successful grassroots approach used at Detroit’s Randolph Career and Technical Center (CTC) to introduce students to the preservation trades.

[St. Louis Preservation Fund from electric permit fees](http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/morning_call/2013/10/bill-would-fund-building-preservation.html)

While this bill did not ultimately pass, it presents an interesting model for contributing to an array of neighborhood interventions (preservation and demolition, or others) through one additional fee. "The fund would be built by adding a new fee to the city's electrical, plumbing and mechanical permits of $4 per $1,000 in permitted work. The money would be split evenly between the preservation and demolition funds. A seven-member commission would determine which empty buildings would be saved. The measure would need to be approved by public vote as well as by the aldermen."

[http://benmarcinphotos.com/houses-i/](http://benmarcinphotos.com/houses-i/)

One of the architectural quirks of certain cities on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. is the solo row house. Standing alone, in some of the worst neighborhoods, these nineteenth century structures were once attached to similar row houses that made up entire city blocks. Time and major demographic changes have resulted in the decay and demolition of many such blocks of row houses. Occasionally, one house is spared - literally cut off from its neighbors and left to the elements with whatever time it has left.

### The Slumlord Project

Baltimore, Maryland

[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaime-rojo-steven-harrington/street-art-blight-activis_b_4067718.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaime-rojo-steven-harrington/street-art-blight-activis_b_4067718.html)

In a twist on the [Broken Windows Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory), street artists are using their skills to combat urban blight in Baltimore with "The Slumlord Project". By drawing the attention of neighbors to abandoned and vacant properties and giving pertinent ownership information to take action on, 17 artists are spray painting and wheat-pasting in a D.I.Y. educational program that aims to renew the social contract in communities hard hit by crumbling real estate, crime, and diminished opportunity. With tongue in cheek, Baltimore street artist Nether calls "The Slumlord Project" an "unsanctioned public art festival," where artists are invited to conceive of targeted installations on neglected properties. Along with Carol Ott, the founder of website and organization [The Slumlord Watch](http://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/), he encouraged artists to create with a sense of focus to draw attention to the companies, investors, private tax payers, and even the Housing Authority of Baltimore City about the large swaths of depressing and dangerous buildings decaying where neighborhoods and communities once flourished.

### Project Row Houses

Houston, Texas

[http://projectrowhouses.org/](http://projectrowhouses.org/)

Project Row Houses (PRH) is a neighborhood-based nonprofit art and cultural organization in Houston’s Northern Third Ward, one of the city’s oldest African-American communities. PRH began in 1993 as a result of discussions among African-American artists who wanted to establish a positive, creative presence in their own community. Artist and community activist Rick Lowe spearheaded the pursuit of this vision when he discovered the abandoned 1 1/2 block site of twenty-two shotgun-style houses in Houston’s Third Ward. The shotgun houses became the perfect opportunity to pursue the creation of a new form of art. They had two key elements: 1) a beautiful form recognized by the renowned Houston artist Dr. John Biggers to be filled with architectural, spiritual, and social significance, and 2) a need for social action among the community to bring the project to life.

### TypeFace

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

[http://www.typefacemke.com/](http://www.typefacemke.com/)

Milwaukee faces a profound challenge without an easy answer. We have an abundance of foreclosed, vacant, and underused spaces. TypeFace, a public art project in four Milwaukee neighborhoods has tapped the expression of communities invested around frustrated/silent spaces to create dynamic art installations. TypeFace began this summer, with community conversations tailored to the unique character of each site and surrounding community. Themes and excerpts from these conversations fed an artistic production process, culminating in installations for each neighborhood. Participating sites include the location where the Main Event once stood in Harambee, the courtyard defined by Franklin Square and Teutonia Gardens in Lindsay Heights, the old Finney Library in Sherman Park, and the former corner store on 31st & Burnham in the Burnham Park neighborhood.

### Spectres of Liberty

New York

[http://spectresofliberty.com/site/](http://spectresofliberty.com/site/)

*Note: Example of creative interpretation of a formerly extant building on a vacant lot.*

Spectres of Liberty is an on-going public, hybrid media project about the history of the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. Through this project we explore the following questions: How do we make visible histories of people and movements which resisted a status quo of oppression? What are the best forms to manifest submerged and complex collective memories? How do artists interact with a public in meaningful ways to animate the history of specific locations?

### Hypothetical Development Organization

New Orleans, Louisiana

[http://hypotheticaldevelopment.com/](http://hypotheticaldevelopment.com/)

The Hypothetical Development Organization, founded in 2010, is dedicated to the recognition and extension of a new form of urban storytelling. Members of this organization begin the narrative process by examining city neighborhoods and commercial districts for compelling structures that appear to have fallen into disuse —"hidden gems" of the built environment. In varying states of repair, these buildings suggest only stories about the past, not the future. As a public service, H.D.O. invents a hypothetical future for each selected structure. Unlike a traditional, reality-based developer, however, our organization is not bound by rules relating to commercial potential, practical materials, or physics. In our view, plausibility is a creative dead end. That is to say: We are not trying to fool anybody. H.D.O. creates convincing renderings of these imagined future uses. These renderings are, in the tradition of the form, printed onto large signs, and shared with the public in general. Each structure selected by H.D.O. will, for a time, present to the world the fascinating potential future we have invented.

### The Heidelberg Project

It is our belief that through the skills and talent of artists and designers and their long term work in the community, a new kind of neighborhood will emerge – one that is creatively and actively enjoyable, safe and sustainable for all.

# Festivals/Events

### OPEN/CLOSED 2011/2012

St. Louis, Missouri

[http://openclosedstl.org/](http://openclosedstl.org/)

*Note: This is not primarily an art-related event but did include film screenings.*

Open/Closed: Exploring Vacant Property in St. Louis is an opportunity for community residents, leaders, artists and activists to strengthen their understanding of the vacant property issue and to develop new ways of seeing, changing and knowing their home. Open/Closed is not a meeting for "movers and shakers", it is, instead, an opportunity for those who want to shake up the region. A way to unsettle what we accept and assume about our present and future. St. Louis faces many challenges, but none are more visceral than the thousands of vacant homes and lots that have a corrosive effect on our community. With one in five addresses currently vacant, we cannot ignore the issue any longer. The political, social and economic factors that create these conditions must be explored. The challenge demands collaborative responsibility and action. The future of the City of St. Louis and the surrounding region requires a commitment to democracy that values different experiences, expertise and perspectives. The organizers of Open/Closed see vacant property as a way to discuss the conflicts, collaborations and struggles that make a city.

### Free City Public Art Festival

Flint, Michigan

Because many federal agencies require applicants to assist in complying with the initial steps of the Section 106 process, applicants will benefit from these tools and access to resources necessary to be effective in this role. By better understanding the requirements of Section 106, applicants can make informed decisions about how they can best facilitate Section 106 reviews, avoid project delays, and improve outcomes. The toolkit provides an overview of the Section 106 process and information on the four-step process, consulting with states and Indian tribes, engaging stakeholders, and avoiding inadvertent activities that may adversely affect historic properties.
