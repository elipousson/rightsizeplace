The Preservation in Legacy Cities Toolkit is a new publication from the [Preservation Rightsizing Network](http://rightsizeplace.org) created to support the work of a diverse preservation community in legacy cities from Chicago to Baltimore to Detroit and beyond. We are working with local preservationist advocates to develop and share practical tools with the goal of creating more livable communities and laying a foundation for the revitalization of historic neighborhoods.
